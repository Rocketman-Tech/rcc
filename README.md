# Welcome to Rocketman Command Center!

## 🚀 What is RCC?

The **Rocketman Command Center (RCC)** is your streamlined solution for macOS device management, designed to complement and extend the capabilities of Jamf Pro. By replacing traditional bash scripts with a modern, modular approach, RCC simplifies workflows, enhances efficiency, and improves security for administrators and Jamf engineers alike.

### Key Features:
- **Simplify Deployment**: Perform critical tasks like FileVault management, temporary admin access, or user privilege adjustments with a single command.
- **Enhance Automation**: Integrate seamlessly with Jamf Pro, leveraging API-driven workflows for precision and control.
- **Improve Security**: Use best practices like secure token handling and encrypted API credentials for secure operations.
- **Global Configuration Options**: Manage settings via `.plist` files, Jamf parameters, or a combination of both.
- **User-Friendly Prompts**: Create SwiftDialog-based interfaces to collect input directly from end users.
